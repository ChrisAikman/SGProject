## Project Timeline
### Tuesday and Wednesday, December 20/21, 2016
I used this time to plan a design, and relearn how to use React. I also researched some of the tools that were mentioned during my interview. I researched, downloaded, and set up Webpack, Mocha, Karma, and LESS, and configured them all to work with React. By the end of Wednesday, I had everything I thought I would need set up for the project.

### Thursday, December 22, 2016
Started figuring out how best to handle the data, and started writing some tests. With the tests, I wrote the code for database management and made sure everything was working. I then got a working recursive comment layout, with tests, and did some initial styling.

### Friday, December 23, 2016
I was surprised with a family visit for a four-day weekend for the holidays, so I tried my best to avoid working. I made some very minor changes.

### Saturday, December 24, 2016
Worked on designing the functionality and began implementing pieces of it.

### Sunday, December 25, 2016
Implemented a good portion of the functionality.

### Monday, December 26, 2016
After my family had to leave, I put in several hours to finalize most of the code.

### Tuesday, December 27, 2016
Minor fixes to polish everything for submission.
